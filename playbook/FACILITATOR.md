**Get everyone on Slack**

    links with each other.
  - Tell hackers to follow directions on http://bit.ly/hackserieshome to signup
    for Slack
  - 1 person demos how to signup for Slack on the projector
    - When you are finished do the same thing as the person below
  - 1 person walks around the room to help people who get stuck
    - Have the hackers who successfully signed up for Slack to help the ones that
      are stuck. Why? Because you don't have enough time to help everyone
      individually.
  - Tell people who have finished setting up slack to explore
    http://bit.ly/hackserieshome

- Show them how to navigate to the workshops on http://bit.ly/hackserieshome
- Tell them that
  - The workshop is self contained and you can just follow it
  - You will get stuck! Ask questions!
    - To facilitators
    - To your neighbors
    - Most importantly to Google

**Facilitate the workshop**

- The first thing you should do is go around and make sure that _EVERYONE_ has
  signup and signed into JS Bin. If they don't, they could lose all their work.
